# Propfix

## Getting Started

In the project directory, run the following commands:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies.

### `yarn start:dev`

Runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Time Spent

Around 3 hours.

## Approach

- Started by creating an imaginary company (logo and favicon).
- Thought about the best way to group the options (tried tabs but was not good on mobile) and found the accordion really fitting here.
- Added icons because the page felt empty.

## Improvements

- Group the options in tabs on larger screens and in an accordion on smaller screens.
- Spend more time on finding the right icons.
- Play around with font family and colors for a better look and feel.
